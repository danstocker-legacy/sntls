Sntls
=====

*Pronounced: "Essentials"*

A collection of general purpose classes and behaviors (class traits) such as collections, sets, profiling, stateful objects, etc.

Currently available
-------------------

Data manipulation:

- `sntls.Hash`: Base for all data-manipulating classes.
- `sntls.OrderedList`: For manipulating order-retaining lists of numbers and strings.
- `sntls.OrderedStringList`: Same as `OrderedList` but with extra string-specific functionality.
- `sntls.Dictionary`: Key-value associations with value multiplicity.
- `sntls.StringDictionary`: For manipulating dictionaries of string values.
- `sntls.Collection`: Offers a way of handling multiple objects as if they were single objects of the same kind.
- `sntls.JournalingCollection`: Collection that records changes.
- `sntls.StringCollection`: Combines collection API with `String` API to manage collections of strings.
- `sntls.ArrayCollection`: Combines collection API with `Array` API to manage collections of arrays.
- `sntls.DateCollection`: Combines collection API with `Date` API to manage collections of date objects.
- `sntls.Path`: Represents paths within a tree-like structure.
- `sntls.Query`: Describes query expressions for paths.
- `sntls.Tree`: Accesses, traverses, and modifies tree-like object structures.

Class behavior:

- `sntls.Profiled`: *Behavior*, lets classes keep a profile.
- `sntls.Stateful`: *Behavior*, adds state matrices to class, triggering specified methods on transitions.

Utility classes:

- `sntls.Profile`: Offers a way of gathering statistics in a multi-level fashion.
- `sntls.StateMatrix`: Associates transitions between named states with arbitrary values.
- `sntls.TreeWalker`: Base class for traversing trees.
- `sntls.IterativeTreeWalker`: Traverses every node in tree.
- `sntls.RecursiveTreeWalker`: Traverses nodes specified by a query expression (`sntls.Query`).
